# Modular Mayhem

Test you abilities in the factory. Collect Upgrades and attach them to your rifle, your gun, your sword... or even yourself!

This short prototype is the first RogueLike game created by me! The objective is to reach the boss room of each level and defeat it, upgrading your inventory in the process. Each upgrade has multiple functions depending on what you attach it to. The same upgrade will have different effects on each weapon, or common effects to all of them if attached to player.

## Controls:

  - Aim: Mouse

  - Fire: Left Click
